Polar was my first game jam game, and my first attempt at working in a team. The game is a 3d platformer that allowed the player to switch between two characters which subsequently unlocked idfferent abilities. Through the combination if these two characters' abilities it would be possible to bypass the obstacles throughout each level in order to move onto the next one.

Polar is available to play, [here](https://alixxir.itch.io/polar)!

### Objectives

Polar was my first game jam game, and my first time developing a game within a team. Although the game jam was a week in length, I had a large list of things I wanted to accomplish in this jam:
* Test my skills against other programmers, to gauge my skill level in comparison
* Work alongside people of different skillsets and help to integrate their ideas into a game
* Plan out the project properly using some planning software to track progress and monitor the steps each team member is on
* Work on some source control where other people had access to, and were committing to, the same repository
* Finish a game

### Responsibilities

Although my responsibilities branched out into different areas as the game jam week progressed, my primary responsibilities during this jam were as follows:
* Menus, UI & Scene Management
* Player Obstacles
* Player Health & Respawns
* Checkpoints
* Build Management
* Level Implementation
* Git Repository Management
* Bug Fixes

### Personal Highlights

#### Checkpoints

Despite my broad range of responsibilities throughout the week, there were areas I was particularly proud of. The first of which was my checkpoint code:
```cs
        private void OnTriggerEnter(Collider other)
        {
            if (other.CompareTag("Player"))
            {
                _checkpointManager.CheckpointHit(this);

                if(_playerHealth == null)
                {
                    _playerHealth = other.GetComponent<Health>();
                }
                
                _playerHealth.SetNewCheckpoint(this.transform);
            }
        }
```
Although fairly straightforward in nature, this code was succinct and to the point with limit room for error. The scalability of this system worked great too, as the later levels required more checkpoints it was simple to add more checkpoints under the checkpoint manager object.

#### Box Obstacle

Additionally, I was responsible for all of the obstacles within the game and one of my favourite obstacles was the box wall whereby I had to ensure only the red player character was able to break (and only during their shoulder barge ability). In the end, I chose to use to isolate when the player was using the correct ability (which was used again when implementing the blue wall mechanic), beyond that it was a simple case of disabling the colliders that might block player movement, and also a very stylistic explosion effect.
```cs
        private void OnTriggerEnter(Collider other)
        {

           if (other.CompareTag("Player") && other.gameObject.layer == 6)
           {    AkSoundEngine.PostEvent("Destroy", this.gameObject);
                foreach (var box in _boxes)
                {
                    box.BlowUp(boxExplosionForce);
                }

                GetComponent<BoxCollider>().enabled = false;
                parent.GetComponent<BoxCollider>().enabled = false;
            }

        }
```

### Project Takeaways

#### Physics - Cohesion is key

*Note to self*: If you're going to use physics to move objects in your game, make sure it's as consistent as possible across the board, we ran into a number of bugs with the moving platform purely because between the two of us programmers we were each using different methods of movement to get our components to work.

#### Github - Conflicts abound

A large amount of time was lost because some commits were made without pulling the latest branch, and previously implemented functionality had to be re-implmented due to each push overwriting newer areas of code. Next time I'll make sure to take the time to outline the teams approach to source control to minimise time spent reverting changes.

#### Namespaces & Assembly Definitions

Despite using namespaces, I hadn't also configured assembly definitions. This meant that as the code-base expanded as the week went on, so did compile times. We ended up submitting on the deadline within the last minute (00:00) and some of this time could have been saved if compile time was minimized during development.

#### Communication is Key

Although using git to track progress between the programmers was okay, a number of bugs could have been prevented entirely if a discussion was had regarding the architecture of the code and how we were planning on implmenting the core functionality across the game. In future I want to communicate with the whole team to anticipate timelines and potential choke points within the project to minimise wait time and allow everyone on the team to focus on their specialities.

#### Scope

We implemented a large amount of interactable functionality, but this resulted in less time to polish each individual area. In future I'm going to try and lean towards a much simpler game mechanics wise so that the team has time to refine their individual elements before the deadline.
