Orbz was my second Game Jam game, where I chose to work in a smaller team and was solely responsible for the code. This game is a 3D rhythm-based aim-trainer experience whereby score is gained by consecutively hitting targets; the score is then multiplied if the player managed to combine two primary colours (comparing the cursor colour and the target's colour), to match the target box colour.

Orbz is available to play, [here](https://alixxir.itch.io/orbz)!

### Objectives

In this Jam I wanted to improve on the processes used in the previous project, but also attempt to do some new techniques:

* Maintain a clear git tree
* Plan the **architecture** in advance
* **Wwise / Unity** integrations
* Have a release ready build the day before the deadline to allow for polish
* Smaller scope

### Responsibilities

As the sole programmer in this team, my responsibilities were many:
* Ensure all the functionality is implemented well in advance of the deadline
* Maintain the github repository
* Implement the scoreboard functionality required for the Game Jam
* Ensure the Wwise integration works correctly
* Implement the UI

#### Modulation & Wwise Callbacks

As part of this game Jam I wanted to improve my understanding of Wwise and it's API:
```cs
    void Update()
    {
        int type = 1;
        float value;

        AkSoundEngine.GetRTPCValue("Modulation", gameObject, 0, out value, ref type);

        // Scaling the value down and smoothing the value a little for visual representation
        value = scaleMultiplier * (value + 48) / 48;
        value = Mathf.Round(value * 1000f) / 1000f;
        value = Mathf.Pow(value, 2);

        // Setting the scale ~
        transform.localScale = Vector3.Lerp(transform.localScale, new Vector3(value, value, value), (Time.deltaTime * smoothingMultiplier));
    }
```
The primary purpose was to produce a visual equaliser-like effect within the game world. This idea lead our game design, as we intended to give the player a better score based on the scale of the **modulating** objects (more points if you can hit the smaller target).

#### Local Integrity Checks

As part of the Game Jam, we were asked to create a **scoreboard** feature. We went with a local scoreboard feature since the game was intended to be posted for play after the end of the Jam, and we didn't want to maintain a scoreboard API for years to come. 

One of the issues with a local scoreboard however is score tampering, especially because a competition would be held in the second half of the Game Jam, allowing streamers to post their scores. It was integral to have some form of score checking to ensure the locally stored scoreboard wasn't tampered with by potential competitors. My (albeit simple) solution was as follows:

```cs
        // A struct was created seperately to contain the username, score and the hash.
        // This code handles the creation of the hash and the integrity check

        // Fairly straightforward function, this code takes the scoreboard data and returns a new version
        // now with 100% more hash!
        private ScoreboardEntryData CreateIntegrityHash(ScoreboardEntryData scoreboardEntryData)
        {
            string combinedValues = scoreboardEntryData.entryName + scoreboardEntryData.entryScore.ToString();
            scoreboardEntryData.entryHash = HashString(combinedValues);
            return scoreboardEntryData;
        }

        // Standard SHA256 generation function
        private string HashString(string stringToHash)
        {
            using (SHA256 sha256Hash = SHA256.Create())
            {
                byte[] data = sha256Hash.ComputeHash(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(stringToHash));
                var sBuilder = new StringBuilder();

                for (int i = 0; i < data.Length; i++)
                {
                    sBuilder.Append(data[i].ToString("x2"));
                }

                return sBuilder.ToString();
            }
        }


        // This function checks the provided score to ensure the generated sha256 hash
        // matches the one stored in the provided struct
        //
        // If not I set the values to make it obvious the player is likely cheating which would
        // be obvious during score submission in the Jam.
        //
        // (Ideally we'd just remove the score, but this makes it easier to determine if anyone has tried to cheat)
        private ScoreboardEntryData CheckHighScore(ScoreboardEntryData highscore)
        {
            string combinedValues = highscore.entryName + highscore.entryScore.ToString();
            string hashedString = HashString(combinedValues);

            if (highscore.entryHash != hashedString)
            {
                highscore.entryName = "1337Haxx0r";
                highscore.entryScore = 0;
                highscore.entryHash = HashString(highscore.entryName + highscore.entryScore.ToString());
            }

            return highscore;

        }
```
This was an interesting challenge, having to approach the techniques I encounter in my consulting work but from the alternate perspective (as a developer instead of a security consultant). With that said, I am familiar enough with secure products that I know this could be improved further.

### Project Retrospective

#### Wwise

It was exciting to work more with Wwise and to integrate it into the game, that said there is still much more to learn there and that's just the API. The software as well has a huge array of features that could be used in my future games and I'm keen to explore this more. Additionally I'm looking forward to when Wwise supports WebGL builds!

#### Online vs. Offline Data Storage

When considering the scoreboard implementation there were a number of factors I had to contemplate in terms of security.

For example, the API provided by the Jam was able to handle the storage of data and used secret keys to ensure the **integrity** of the data, but it wasn't using **HTTPS** so now **transport security** was a concern! An alternative was to create my own API, which would take further development time and maintaining it would require additional resources.

#### Math Considerations

Due to the way in which I applied score multipliers, I was required to use ```unsigned longs``` to store the score data. If I were to use an online API to store the score I would have to check to make sure my game didn't break the API's limits with the sheer size of the scores alone. Through this discovery I've determined that spending more time considering small areas of the code architecture is more advantageous in the long term.
