I am currently a **Senior Cyber Security Consultant** and hobbyist game programmer, based in **Gloucestershire, UK**. I'm a self-taught programmer that has specialised in **Unity** and **C#** over the past year with the hopes to transition into games programming.
I graduated from the **University of the West of England (UWE)** with First-class Honours in **BSc. Computer Security** and have worked in the cyber security industry as a consultant since graduation.

As a security consultant I work with clients and developers to address critical security risks to a wide variety of equipment and applications. Despite not developing applications directly however, I often work with incredibly complex systems and implement my own security tooling (using **python** and **bash**) in order to further demonstrate the risks I have identified. I believe some of these skills to be transferable, notably the capability to immediately mock up a tool for testing and interacting with complex applications, and the experience to identify issues with current designs before they're implemented. I also have some experience reverse engineering binaries and am somewhat familiar with basic **C**, **C++** and **Intel Assembly (x86/x64)**, despite my current specialisation in **Unity** and **C#**.

**Whilst I am not working** I am often found either learning more about games programming, game jamming, or working on my own games. All of which I keep track of over on my [github](https://www.github.com/AlexDonisthorpe).

### I'm currently looking for:
* A junior games programming opportunity
* A mentor to help me further improve
* Any and all interesting resources on games programming
* Like-minded colleagues!
