I am currently a **Senior Cyber Security Consultant** and hobbyist game programmer, based in **Gloucestershire, UK**. I'm a self-taught programmer that has specialised in **Unity** and **C#** over the past year with the hopes to transition into games programming.
I graduated from the **University of the West of England (UWE)** with First-class Honours in **BSc. Computer Security** and have worked in the cyber security industry as a consultant since graduation.

As a security consultant I work with clients and developers to address critical security risks to a wide variety of equipment and applications. Despite not developing applications directly however, I often work with incredibly complex systems and implement my own security tooling (using **python** and **bash**) in order to further demonstrate the risks I have identified. I believe some of these skills to be transferable, notably the capability to immediately mock up a tool for testing and interacting with complex applications, and the experience to identify issues with current designs before they're implemented. I also have some experience reverse engineering binaries and am somewhat familiar with basic **C**, **C++** and **Intel Assembly (x86/x64)**, despite my current specialisation in **Unity** and **C#**.

**Whilst I am not working** I am often found either learning more about games programming, game jamming, or working on my own games. All of which I keep track of over on my [github](https://www.github.com/AlexDonisthorpe).

### I'm currently looking for:
* A junior games programming opportunity
* A mentor to help me further improve
* Any and all interesting resources on games programming
* Like-minded colleagues!

Polar was my teams' entry into the GameJobsLive 2021 Game Jam; it was also my first game jam experience. I was one of two programmers in the team, my main responsibilities were to ensure that the **UI** was functional, the **checkpoint** and **player respawn** functionality was operational, and the player had **obstacles** to overcome. By the end of the jam I had touched almost every part of the game, from fixing player **physics bugs**, to redesigning and implementing the levels that the player would traverse through (I even ended up coding my first shader, albeit a fairly simple one). 

Although we didn't end up implemented all of our planned features, I was proud to release this game within the 7 day time limit. I intend to do further work on Polar, ironing out some of the more prominent bugs we identified towards the end of the game jam;  as well as fully implementing features that were rushed closer to the deadline.

### RPG Sandbox

This is a longer project I've been working on, the goal for this project was to learn as much as I could about more advanced programming techniques. Specifically I wanted to know how a large collection of complex systems would interact with each other, and how to develop large projects knowing that many complex features would need to co-exist. Generally this involved digging around, looking at **design patterns** and coding best practises whilst the game scaled into a fully-featured RPG. 

With that said, from a technical standpoint I'm particularly proud of the **saving system** implemented in this game, using **C# interfaces** to identify which classes needed to save component values, then **serializing** them and putting them into a save file on disk whilst also ensuring some of this information was accessible across scenes, whilst others not. Additionally, I put a lot of attention into the enemy **AI** and the **player states** which would determine their behaviour on a moment-to-moment basis.

I was also starting to look into using my experience as an security consultant here to identify potential areas if exploitation (mainly **race conditions** in this case), which resulted in a deeper understanding of **Unity's order of execution**, and when and where a lot of functionality should occur within the codebase.

I have a collection of small games now that I've been working on for the past year, although many are not as fully featured as alternatives in their genre they were great platforms for learning **Unity**, **C#** and **Game Development**. Each one an improvement over the last, I have learnt and continue to learn more and more as each day passes, and I'm excited to continue my gamedev journey.

Please feel free to take a look at all of my old and new projects over on my github!
