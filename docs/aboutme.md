Hello, my name is **Alex Donisthorpe**. I'm a career **penetration tester** (**ethical hacker**) looking to make a career change into **gameplay programming**.

Iâ€™m a **self-taught** programmer that has specialised in **Unity** and **C#** over the past year, but with experience coding in **C++**, **bash**, **python** and **x86 Intel assembly** and **reverse engineering** C++ and assembly code in particular.

I'm either working, learning, coding or playing games and I'd love to be able to combine these things more in future!

<h1 style="text-align: center;">My Experience</h1>
<hr class="medium">

Over the past year I've developed a number of games using a variety of study material. But I've also been taking my coding skills into **game jams** recently to gain more experience. I've had a great time in the game jams I've participated in, and am summarily pleased with both [Polar](linkToPolarBlogHere) and [Orbz](linkToOrbzBlogHere).

As a consultant I've also had to integrate with a wide variety of software teams' **complex software**, **source control** and **development methodologies** (usually **Agile** in approach). I'm now confident I can integrate into any teams processes comfortably and with minimal downtime.

Additionally I have experience reverse engineering applications to find and exploit **security vulnerabilities**, this has resulted in strong **debugging** and problem solving skills even before bugs occur within my code.

I love to play games, not just make them!

My favourite genres are action, adventure, platforming, massively multipler and e-sports.
With that in mind, I'm usually found in some form of a raid group on an MMO (I'm currently enjoying **Final Fantasy XIV**'s savage difficulty raids)! Or deep in the competitive ranking systems of competitive games (although I usually end up playing **League of Legends**!).

Outside of games though you'll find me enjoying countryside **hikes** and **walks** with my dog **Peanut**, or **training** him for said hikes!
