Hello, my name is **Alex Donisthorpe**. I'm a career **penetration tester** (**ethical hacker**) looking to make a career change into **gameplay programming**.

Iâ€™m a **self-taught** programmer that has experience in both **Unity/C#** and **Unreal/C++**, and experience coding in **bash**, **python** and **x86 Intel assembly** alongside some experience **reverse engineering** C, C++ and intel assembly.

I'm either working, learning, coding or playing games and I aspire to develop games as a full-time career in future!

<span class="test">root@alex:~$ history 100 | grep experience</span>

Over the past year I've developed a number of games using a variety of study material. But I've also been taking my coding skills into **game jams** recently to gain more experience **working in teams**. I've had a great time in the game jams I've participated in, and am summarily pleased with both [Polar](linkToPolarBlogHere) and [Orbz](linkToOrbzBlogHere).

As a consultant I have also had to integrate with a wide variety of software teams' **complex software**, **source control** and **development methodologies** (usually **Agile** in approach). I am confident I can integrate into most team's processes comfortably and with minimal downtime.

Additionally I have experience reverse engineering applications to find and exploit **security vulnerabilities**, this has resulted in strong **debugging** and **problem solving skills** even before bugs occur within the code I am working on.

I love to play games, not just make them!

I'm usually found in some form of a raid group on an MMO (I'm currently enjoying **Final Fantasy XIV**'s savage difficulty raids)! Or deep in the competitive ranking systems of competitive games (although I usually end up playing **League of Legends**! or **Destiny 2**).

Outside of games though you'll find me enjoying countryside **hikes** and **walks** with my dog **Peanut**, or **training** him for said hikes!
